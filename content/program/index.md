## Sessions
#### Causal inference 

How do asymmetric and context-specific models generate more flexible causal inference? 

#### Categorical Data 

Asymmetric and contex-specific graphical models ar eparticularly adept at handling categorical data. 

#### Dynamic Variants

Tree-based and context-specific models are being adapted to include dynamic variants.

#### Algebraic 

This session discusses algebraic advancements adjacent to context-specific and asymmetric graphical models. 
#### Applications

This session explores powerful applications of these broader models. Particular cases include legal applications and medial studies.
