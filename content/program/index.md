## Tutorial 

Title: Using the `stagedtrees` packageto fit Staged Event Trees  
Speaker: Dr. Gherardo Varando

## Sessions
#### Causal inference 

How do asymmetric and context-specific models generate more flexible causal inference? 

##### Speakers
* Xuewen Yu, University of Warwick

#### Categorical Data 

Asymmetric and contex-specific graphical models are particularly adept at handling categorical data. 

##### Speakers:
* Dr. Federica Nicolussi, University of Milan

#### Dynamic Variants

Tree-based and context-specific models are being adapted to include dynamic variants.

##### Speakers
* Dr. Aditi Shenvi, University of Warwick
* Dr. Rodrigo Collazo
* Dr. Oliver Bunnin, Alan Turing Institute

#### Algebraic 

This session discusses algebraic advancements adjacent to context-specific and asymmetric graphical models. 
##### Speakers

*Dr. Eliana Duarte, Otto-von-Guericke Universit√§t Magdeburg

#### Applications

This session explores powerful applications of these broader models. Particular cases include legal applications and medial studies.

##### Speakers

* Dr. Gail Robertson, Universty of Edinburgh
