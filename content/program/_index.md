The program will be composed of a keynote talk, a tutorial on software packages, and four sessions of particular subtopics. The subtopics are: 

#### Causal inference 

How do asymmetric and context-specific models generate more flexible causal inference? 

#### Categorical Data 

Tree-based models are particularly relevant for categorical data.

#### Dynamic Variants

Dynamic adapatation of tree-based models are appearing on the horizon.

#### Algebraic 

Algebraic advancements necessary for building models.

#### Applications

This session explores powerful applications of these broader models. Particular cases include legal applications and medial studies.
