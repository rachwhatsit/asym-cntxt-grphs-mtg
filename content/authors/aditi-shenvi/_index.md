I recently completed my PhD at the University of Warwick on modelling dynamic asymmetric processes with chain event graphs, looking at applications in public health and policing. I will be starting a postdoc at Warwick in September this year. 

My research interests include:
* Probabilistic graphical models
* Analysis of missingness
* Mixture models
* Development of model selection and inference algorithms

I work within a Bayesian framework. More generally, I'm interested in developing new and adapting existing methodologies to find practical solutions to complex real-world problems â€“ in particular those that lead to improving the health of people and the environment.
