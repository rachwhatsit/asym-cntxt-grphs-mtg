I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Sciences and Technology at IE University, Madrid. I am working in Bayesian statistics and decision analysis, more specifically:

* Graphical models for decision support

* Sensitivity analysis and symbolic methods

* Evidence synthesis

* Extreme value theory

I am the Editor of Bernoulli News.

During my PhD I have developed a framework, named integrating decision support system, to combine a suite of probabilistic models to support decision makers in complex domains.
