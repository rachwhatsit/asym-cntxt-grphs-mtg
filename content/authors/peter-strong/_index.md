I am a second year PhD student in the Mathematics of Real-World Systems (Mathsys) CDT at the University of Warwick, supervised by Jim Smith and Weisi Guo. My research interests include models of migration and probabilistic graphical models. My current work involves using Chain event graphs to provide a Bayesian framework for agent-based models of migrant's journeys, more specifically those between Myanmar and Thailand to inform safer migration interventions aiming to prevent human trafficking and labour exploitation.
