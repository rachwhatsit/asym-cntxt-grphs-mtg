Iâ€™ve spent my career in financial markets as a rates derivatives trader at MUFG; a Fixed Income / rates quantitative developer at Salomon Brothers / Citigroup; and currently as a counter-party risk quant developer at NatWest Markets. From 2019 to early 2021 I worked at the Alan Turing Institute in the Defence and Security programme on Graphical Models for counterterrorism and modern slavery. I studied Computing, Economics and Chinese many years ago. I have lived in Wivenhoe, Leeds, Taipei, Narita, Tokyo, and my favourite place, London. I enjoy open water swimming, spending time in Nature and bringing up my three children to say nothing of the dog.
